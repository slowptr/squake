# squake
Port of the Squake mod to fabric 1.20.1. Credit to squeek502 and ZeithComms for the original and 1.16.5 port respectively.

Requires modmenu and cloth config in order to change settings, but the defaults should be fine

See the releases tab for prebuilt binary

changes (for now):
- remove hud
- remove limb-swing handling
- enable Xlint deprecation feature

i think it bugs on taking fall damage, prob. have to fix that :)
